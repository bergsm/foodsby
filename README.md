Foodsby Code Challenge

Challenge 1: Front End 

The goal for this exercise is to create a web application using provided assets, designs and data mocks ups. 
Ideally the application will consist of separate web components which can be interacted with. 
When a user clicks on a new date in the date picker, the content on the page should be swapped out based on the JSON file provided. 

Complete the exercise using any HTML, CSS and JavaScript. 
You may use any JS based templating libraries, CSS preprocessors, and JS transpilers you like. 
Additionally you can choose any modern JS libraries  or frameworks you like. 

Use Node.JS to run the application and perform your (optional) tests. Take your pick and have fun!
